# Your Capstone Project

## Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most
advanced project to date, and if you put creativity into it, it'll hopefully
be the thing you want to show off most prominently in your portfolio.

You get to call the shots and invent your own idea, choosing a framework and
tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything
you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little
outside of your comfort zone**.

Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructor so you can make
sure it's something you can accomplish in the limited time we have, and make
sure it's something that'll be impressive visually. Sometimes people do
judge a book by its cover – or an app by its design.
